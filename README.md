Is a quicker way to start with Expo + Firebase (using JS SDK) projects. It includes:

- based on Expo SDK `45`
- navigation using `react-navigation` 6.x.x
- Firebase JS SDK v9
- Firebase as backend for email auth
- custom and reusable components
- custom hook to toggle password field visibility on a TextInput
- handles server errors using Formik
- Login, Signup & Password Reset form built using Formik & yup
- show/hide Password Field's visibility 👁
- uses a custom Provider using Context API & Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` handler to checks user's auth state with
- handles Forgot Password Reset using Firebase email method
- uses [Expo Vector Icons](https://icons.expo.fyi/)
- uses [KeyboardAwareScrollView](https://github.com/APSL/react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view) package to handle keyboard appearance and automatically scrolls to focused TextInput
- uses `dotenv` and `expo-constants` packages to manage environment variables (so that they are not exposed on public repositories)
- all components are now functional components and use [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

## Installation

1. Create a new project using the firebase starter template.

```bash
npx create-react-native-app --template https://github.com/expo-community/expo-firebase-starter
```

2. Rename the file `example.env` to `.env`
3. Update `.env` with your own configuration, e.g.:

```shell
# Rename this file to ".env" before use
# Replace XXXX's with your own Firebase config keys
API_KEY=XXXX
AUTH_DOMAIN=XXXX
PROJECT_ID=XXXX
STORAGE_BUCKET=XXXX
MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=XXXX
APP_ID=XXXX
```

4. Start the project:

- `yarn ios` -- open on iOS
- `yarn android` -- open on Android

## ⚠️ Please Note

Expo uses Firebase Web SDK and does not support all Firebase services such as phone auth. If you are looking forward to use those services, please use `react-native-firebase` in a Expo bare project, or an [Expo custom dev client](https://blog.expo.dev/introducing-custom-development-clients-5a2c79a9ddf8) or a plain React Native project.

[**Here is more on what and why Expo cannot support complete Firebase integration**](https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/full-native-firebase-integration)
